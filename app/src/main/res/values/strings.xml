        <b>What is Skin Purging?</b>
        When it comes down to it, the question of the hour is—what is purging skin? Simply put, a skin purge occurs when your skin reacts to an active ingredient in a new skincare product.
        Symptoms of Skin Purging
        As those blemishes make an expedited exit through the skin\'s surface, they can take shape in a variety of forms. While the purging process is different for each person, generally, symptoms of skin purging include:
        • Whiteheads
        • Blackheads
        • Papules
        • Pustules
        • Dry, flaky sensitive skin
        The skin purging process can easily be mistaken for an acne flare-up. With pimples, blackheads, redness, and bumps that give your skin a rough texture, it’s easy to see why. But with the right information, you’ll be able to tell if it’s only a temporary setback like "the purge."
        For example, let’s say you’re using a product that contains ingredients like retinol, glycolic acid, or another exfoliating acid, which help to expedite cellular turnover. When you shed your dead skin cells, you’re replacing them with fresh, more radiant, healthier skin cells underneath.

        Dermatitis is General; Eczema is Specific
        You know how a croissant is a delicious, buttery, flaky form of pastry—but not all pastries are croissants? In the same way, eczema is a type of dermatitis, but not all dermatitis is eczema.
        To help you fully understand the difference, we’ll explain what eczema is and then explore the other common types of dermatitis below.

        Eczema, AKA Atopic Dermatitis
        Dermatitis is a catch-all term for inflamed and irritated skin. Eczema is a specific type, sometimes called “atopic dermatitis.”[3] Eczema is thought to be linked to an overactive immune system and can develop at any age, but it commonly first appears in childhood.

        If you’re suffering from severe eczema specifically, you might have the following skin symptoms:[4]

        Itchy, red skin
        Rashes, usually on the elbows, knees, or other joints
        Dry, scaly skin patches
        Clear fluid that oozes from patchy areas
